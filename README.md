# TwitchIntegration
Hades Twitch Integration

This version has been modified by Kruffles. For the most part, all of the changes have been limited to event_list.lua.
If you find that your votes are only generating 4 of the same option, look for the DEBUGGING section in twitch.lua and set local debugid = nil

Please rename the extracted repository to TwitchIntegration from Hades-Twitch-Integration for the packages to work.

Config: Set your username and vote times in config.lua

TODO: Add more effects and complete this readme.
